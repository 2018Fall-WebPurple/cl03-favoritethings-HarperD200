        <h1>Pictures of My Favorite Things</h1>
        <h6>Note: All drawings are my own and all pictures were taken by me.</h6>
    
        <p> My first three pictures are drawings I have made for my phone background. I am okay with other people using the drawings as their own phone's background, as long as they keep in mind the drawing is not their own. </p>
        
            <!-- These three drawings could be made smaller -->

        <img id="pumpkin" src="pumpkindrawing.png" alt="A drawing of a pumpkin" title="A drawn black pumpkin with reddish-orange leaves around it." />
        <figcaption>A drawing I made of a pumpkin surrounded by leaves for my phone background for the Halloween season. I like this drawing because it's simple and cute but also reminds me it's spooky season each time I look at my phone.

        <img id="stars1" src="starsdrawing.png" alt="A drawing of stars in the sky" title="Stars drawn in the sky with trees in the background." />
        <figcaption>A drawing I made of stars in the sky with two trees on the side and trees in the background. It was my home screen background for my phone before I created the pumpkin one above.

        <img id="stars2" src="starswdrawing.png" alt="The same drawing of stars in the sky but now with the words 'Don't You Just Love The Stars' near the middle/bottom of the screen." title="Stars drawn in the sky with trees in the background and the words 'Don't You Just Love The Stars'" />
        <figcaption>The same drawing I had made that is displayed above but now with the words "Don't You Just Love The Stars" near the middle/bottom of the drawing. This used to be my lock screen before I switched to the pumpkin drawing.

        <p> My next few pictures are pictures I have taken of either my own pets or of my cow I used to show. </p>

    <figure>
        <img id="copper" src="copper2.png" alt="A brown and white dog laying on a deck looking at the trees." title="My dog Copper laying and looking at the trees." />
        <figcaption>This is a picture of my dog, Copper. While I do not know the mix of breeds he is I do know he was born on a farm. I got him when I was in first grade and his birthday is on June 14. He is nine years old currently and he is a good boy.

        <img id="cinder" src="cinder2.png" alt="A gray cat sitting on a deck looking to the side." title="My cat Cinder sitting and looking to the side." />
        <figcaption>This is a picture of my older gray cat, Cinder. He is a domestic shorthair and is generally kept indoors, though he sometimes escapes when we open the door. We got him after my father picked my sisters and I up from an overnight camp and we drove past a driveway with a "Free Kittens" sign. He was the last of his litter and was about nine weeks old when we got him. He is currently three (??) years old.
